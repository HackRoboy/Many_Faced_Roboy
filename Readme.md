# The Many Faced Roboy
## The Idea
The Many Faced Roboy is an interactive Game using Roboys many "Faces" and the Device of your choice (as long as it supports Telegram). The main idea is to showcase many technical possibilities of roboy as well as their integration into other systems while enjoying a fun and interactive game.

## Overview
The system is split into a small client service which is simply used to enable communication to a chosen device via Telegram and the server which contains all the game logic and Roboy interaction. The Implementation is primarly done in Python (containing Python3 and Python2) but also uses some UNIX bash scripts.

## The Game
The player can only engage Roboy while facing the camera. There are multiple quests available using different interaction techniques. For example some gps based fetch quests, htc vive controller interactions (e.g. present a "sword" (controller) to Roboy) and general speech interactions with branching storylines. At the same time, Roboy will use speech, movement and even its emotion change system (or rather face change) to interact with the player.

## General
The program was written in a 3 day period for the Hack Roboy #2 Hackathon in April 2017. It was done in a team of four with two main programmers and 2 engineers
