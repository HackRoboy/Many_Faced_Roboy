# The Many Faced Roboy
## The Idea
The Many Faced Roboy is an interactive Game using Roboys many "Faces" and the Device of your choice (as long as it supports Telegram). The main idea is to showcase multiple many technical possibilities of roboy as well as their integration into other system all while having a fun game for a demo.

## Overview
The system is split into a very small client service which is simply used to enable communication to a chosen device via Telegram and the server which contains all the game logic and Roboy interaction. The Implementation is primarly done in Python (containing Python3 and Python2) but also uses some UNIX bash scripts.
